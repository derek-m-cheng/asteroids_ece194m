Honestly, I had a lot of issues with this project. I finished the walkthrough at around 7pm and left my computer for a while. 
When I came back at around 8pm, I came back to my computer and proceeded to build my project. Upon building it, my project failed to run.
StackOverflow and google didn't give me any good responses so I emailed Anshul at 8:36pm. I had no idea how to fix the error, so I decided to
power through it and do another run through of the project. I finished at around 2:30am, and filmed a video recording the project in case building it
caused it to break again. Lo and behold, when I built the project, everything stopped working. However, I decided to try and fix the issue. I downloaded
an experimental feature in the client and updated my Unity version. After I updated my files and created new scenes, everything was working and I am honestly 
dumbfounded.
